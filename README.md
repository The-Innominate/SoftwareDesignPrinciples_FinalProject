# SoftwareDesignPrinciples_FinalProject

## Project Overview
This project is a foundational C# application built to demonstrate software design principles using a very simple madlib. It follows a clean, organized structure prepared for future feature development.

## Project Structure
- `Models/` — Data structures and business logic classes.
- `Views/` — UI components or presentation logic (it will just be console based).
- `Controllers/` — Application flow and interaction handlers.
- `Tests/` — Unit and integration tests.

## Future Plans
- Implement core features using MVC pattern.
- Add comprehensive tests to ensure code quality.
- Expand with additional modules as needed.

## Notes
- Visual Studio solution and project files included.
- `.gitignore` configured to exclude environment-specific files.
